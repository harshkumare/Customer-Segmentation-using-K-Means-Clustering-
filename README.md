# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering-
This project employs K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information. By analyzing patterns in the data, the model identifies distinct customer groups, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement. The implementation includes data preprocessing, cluster analysis, and visualizations to represent the segmentation results effectively. This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning techniques in real-world business scenarios, enabling better decision-making and targeted marketing efforts.
